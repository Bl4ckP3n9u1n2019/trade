trade

**trade** is a framework for the creation of financial applications.


It uses the concept of *holders*, *subjects* and *occurrences*
--------------------------------------------------------------
A *subject* represent anything that can be traded.

An *occurrence* represent anything that affects one or more subjects.

A *holder* is someone who owns subjects and may perform *occurrences*.

*Occurrences* may happen without intervention of the holder.

*Occurrences* may occur alone or in *contexts*, like a group of operations performed within a day.


Different subjects may have different attributes
------------------------------------------------
A *subject* may be the share of a corporation, wooden logs, livestock and so on.


An occurrence involves one or many subjects
-------------------------------------------


A subject may relate to none or many subjects
---------------------------------------------
The subject of an occurrence may be related to some underlyng subject (like it is with a *put option*,
for example); Occurrences with this subject may have effects on its underlying subjects.


A *context* may have its own rules
----------------------------------
*Contexts* are groups of occurrences.

A *context* may be a situation where daytrades should be identified.

A *context* may also involve taxes and other costs altering the details of the occurrences.


Extending the framework
-----------------------

**trade** can be extended with new types of *occurrences* and *subjects*.
New *context rules* can be created. Look at the examples.


You can try it `live <https://python-trade.appspot.com>`_.


Use:

A example without the use of contexts:

.. code:: python

	from trade.holder import Holder
	from trade.occurrence import Occurrence
	from trade.subject import Subject

	# create a holder
	holder = Holder()

	# define some subject
	some_asset = Subject('AST1', 'Some Asset')

	# create an occurrence with that subject.
	# In this example, a purchase of 100 units of the asset,
	# for the price of $20.
	some_occurrence = Occurrence(
			subject=some_asset,
			date='2018-01-02',
			quantity=100,
			price=20
		)

	# pass it to the holder
	holder.accumulate(some_occurrence)

	# check the holder state:
	for subject, subject_details in holder.subjects.items():
		print(subject)
		print(subject_details.state)
	# AST1
	# {'price': 20.0, 'results': {}, 'quantity': 100}


	# create some other occurrence with that subject.
	# In this example, a sale of 20 units of the asset,
	# for the price of $30.
	other_occurrence = Occurrence(
			subject=some_asset,
			date='2018-01-02',
			quantity=-20,
			price=30
		)
	holder.accumulate(other_occurrence)

	# check the holder state. It should show a change in quantity
	# and some profit:
	for subject, subject_details in holder.subjects.items():
		print(subject)
		print(subject_details.state)
	# AST1
	# {'price': 20.0, 'results': {'trades': 200.0}, 'quantity': 80}


	# create some other occurrence with that subject.
	# Now a purchase of 10 units of the asset, for the
	# price of $20.
	another_occurrence = Occurrence(
			subject=some_asset,
			date='2018-01-02',
			quantity=10,
			price=25
		)
	holder.accumulate(another_occurrence)

	# check the holder state. It should show a change in quantity
	# and in the price paid for each unit of the subject:
	for subject, subject_details in holder.subjects.items():
		print(subject)
		print(subject_details.state)
	# AST1
	# {'price': 20.555555555555557, 'results': {'trades': 200.0}, 'quantity': 90}
