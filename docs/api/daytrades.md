With this plugin the trade module can:
- Identify daytrades in a group of operations
- Separate daytrades from other operations on the OperationContainer
- Accumulate Daytrades on the portfolio

It provides:
- Daytrade, a subclass of Operation
- the fetch_daytrades() task for the OperationContainer

Daytrades will update the asset state adding results but will not change the
quantity or the cost of the asset on the Portfolio.


## Daytrade(Operation):
A day trade operation.

Day trades are operations of purchase and sale of an Asset on
the same date.

### Attributes:
+ asset: An asset instance, the asset that is being traded.
+ quantity: The traded quantity of the asset.
+ purchase: A Operation object representing the purchase of the asset.
+ sale: A Operation object representing the sale of the asset.
+ update_position: Set to False, as day trades don't change the portfolio position; they just create results.

### Properties:

#### results
Returns the profit or the loss generated by the day trade.

### Methods:

#### ``__init__(self, operation_a, operation_b)``
Creates the daytrade object.

Based on the informed values this method creates 2 operations:
- a purchase operation
- a sale operation

Both operations can be treated like any other operation when it
comes to taxes and the prorate of commissions.

#### update_accumulator(self, accumulator)
Updates the accumulator state with the day trade result.

#### extract_daytrade(self, purchase, sale)
Extracts the daytraded quantity from 2 operations.

#### append_to_container_positions(self, container)
Saves a Daytrade object in the container positions.

If there is already a day trade with the same asset on the
container, then the day trades are merged.

#### merge_underlying(self, container, operation_index)
Merges one day trade underlying operation.


## fetch_daytrades(container):
An OperationContainer task.

Fetches the daytrades from the OperationContainer operations.

The daytrades are placed on the container positions under the
'daytrades' key, inexed by the Daytrade asset's symbol.


## daytrade_condition(operation_a, operation_b):
Checks if two operations are day trades.


## find_purchase_and_sale(operation_a, operation_b):
Finds which operation is a purchase and which is a sale.
