## Basic example

```python
import trade

# create the asset and the operation
asset = trade.Asset(name='some asset')
operation = trade.Operation(
    date='2015-09-18',
    asset=asset,
    quantity=20,
    price=10
)

# create a container with some
# commissions associated with it
commissions = {
    'some commission': 1,
    'other commission': 3,
}
container = trade.OperationContainer(
    operations=[operation],
    commissions=commissions
)

# identify common operations and daytrades
# and prorate the comissions
container.fetch_positions()

# create an accumulator for the asset
accumulator = trade.Accumulator(asset)

# accumulate the operation
operation = container.common_operations[asset]
accumulator.accumulate_operation(operation)

print(accumulator.quantity)
#>>20

print(accumulator.price)
#>>10.2
# the original price (10) plus the commissions
# the OperationContainer prorated (default taxes are zero)
```
