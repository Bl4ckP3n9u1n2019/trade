+ quantity: The traded quantity of the asset.

### Properties:

#### results

### Methods:

#### ``__init__(self, operation_a, operation_b)``
Creates the daytrade object.

Based on the informed values this method creates 2 operations:

Both operations can be treated like any other operation when it
comes to taxes and the prorate of commissions.

Updates the accumulator state with the day trade result.

#### extract_daytrade(self, purchase, sale)
Extracts the daytraded quantity from 2 operations.

#### append_to_container_positions(self, container)

If there is already a day trade with the same asset on the

#### merge_underlying(self, container, operation_index)
