This plugin is an example of vanilla call and put operations on the trade module.

With this plugin you can:
- Create calls and puts that references underlying assets
- Create exercise operations that change both the option and underlying
  asset position on the portfolio

It provides:
- Option, a subclass of Asset
- Exercise, a subclass of Operation
- the fetch_exercises() task for the OperationContainer
- the fetch_exercise_operations() task for the Portfolio


## Option(Asset):
Represents a vanilla option.

Represents both calls and puts.

This class can be used for common option operations or as a base
for classes that represent exotic options.

### Attributes:
+ name: A string representing the name of the asset.
+ symbol: A string representing the symbol of the asset.
+ expiration_date: A string 'YYYY-mm-dd' representing the expiration date of the asset, if any.
+ underlying_assets: A dict of Asset objects representing the underlying assets of this asset and the ratio to which the asset relates to the Option. It looks like this: {Asset: float}

### Methods:

#### exercise(self, quantity, price, date, premium=0):
Exercises the option.

If a premium is informed, then it will be considered on the
underlying asset operation cost.

Returns a list of operations:
    - one operation with zero value representing the option
      being consumed by the exercise;
    - operations representing the purchase or sale of its
      underlying assets


## Exercise(Operation):
An exercise operation.

An exercise will likely change the state of both the derivative and its
underlying assets.

### Attributes:
+ update_position set to False.
+ update_container set to False.

### Methods:

#### update_portfolio(self, portfolio)
A Portfolio task.

Fetch the operations in a exercise operations and  get the premium
of the option that is being exercised.

It searches on the Portfolio object for an Accumulator of the option
and then use the accumulator cost as the premium to be included
on the exercise operation price.

#### update_accumulator(self, accumulator)
Exercise operations should not update the accumulator.
Its its underlying operations that should update the
accumulator.

#### fetch_operations(self, portfolio=None)
Fetch the operations created by this exercise.

If a portfolio is informed, then the premium of the option
will be considered.

An exercise creates multiple operations:
- one operation to consume the option that it being exercised
- operations to represent the sale or the purchase of each of its underlying assets, if any.


## fetch_exercises(container)
An OperationContainer task.

Fetch all exercise operations on the container into a single
exercise (by asset) on the container positions dictionary under
the key 'exercises'.
