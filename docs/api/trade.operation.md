# trade.operation

This module contains the class definitions of Asset, Operation,

```


## trade.operation.Asset
An asset represents anything that can be traded.

Asset objects can be created with or without a name.

### Attributes:
+ name: A string representing the name of the asset.
+ expiration_date: A string 'YYYY-mm-dd' representing the expiration date of the asset, if any.

### Methods:

#### _ _ init _ _ (self, name='', expiration_date=None):
Asset objects can be created empty or with name and expiration date.

#### _ _ deepcopy _ _ (self, memo)
Assets always return a reference to themselves when being copied, so they
are never really copied.

  representing the name of the discounts and the values
  to be deducted from the operation.

  taxes to be applied to the operation. Tax values are always
  represented as a percentage. Taxes are applied based on the
  volume of the operation.

### Properties:

The real price is the price with all comissions and taxes
already deducted or added.

## trade.operation.Daytrade

Daytrades are operations of purchase and sale of an Asset on
the same date.

### Attributes:

+ quantity: The traded quantity of the asset.
+ purchase: A Operation object representing the purchase of the asset.

### Properties

#### result
Returns the profit or the loss generated by the daytrade.

### Methods:

#### init(self, date, asset, quantity, buy_price, sale_price)

Base on the informed values this method creates 2 operations:
- a purchase operation
- a sale operation

Both operations (self.purchase and self.sale) can be treated
like any other operation when it comes to taxes and prorate
of commissions.
