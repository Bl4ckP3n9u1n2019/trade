## trade

**trade** is a framework for the development of financial applications. It operates
on the concept of *subjects* and *occurrences*. A *subject* represents anything that
can be traded, while an *occurrence* represents anything that affects one or more
subjects, like a stock exchange operation or a stock split.

It was developed to work with any kind of *subject* and *occurrence* related to
the financial market, and also to work under specific rules of different markets
across the World, by following these principles:

- different subjects may have different attributes
- a subject may be related to none or many other subjects
- an occurrence must involve one or many subjects
- there may be an existing context for any subject
- different occurrences can implement different processes with their subjects
- an occurrence may update the state of none or many subjects

Extending the framework with market-specific rules and operations should be as
simple as creating new types of subjects and occurrences.

You can try it [live](https://python-trade.appspot.com).

There is an ongoing effort in [documenting this project](http://trade.readthedocs.org).
Check it out.


## In a nutshell

**trade** works like a service. The user informs the items he have in stock and a series
of subsequent occurrences (purchases, sales, whatsoever) with those or other items.
**trade** then calculates the effects of those occurrences and gives back the
new amounts and costs of the items in stock.


## Quickstart

An example of the JSON interface:

```python

    import trade
    interface = trade.TradeJSON()

    json_input = '''{
        "subjects": {
            "GOOG": {
                "type": "Asset",
                "name": "Google Inc"
            },
            "AAPL": {
                "type": "Asset",
                "name": "Apple, Inc."
            }
        },
        "occurrences": [
            {
                "type": "Operation",
                "subject": "AAPL",
                "date": "2015-11-10",
                "quantity": 10,

            },
            {
                "type": "Operation",
                "subject": "GOOG",
                "date": "2015-11-10",
                "quantity": 10,
                "price": 724.89
            },
            {
                "type": "Operation",
                "subject": "GOOG",
                "date": "2015-11-10",
                "quantity": -5,
                "price": 724.98
            }
        ],
        "initial state": {
            "AAPL": {
                "date": "2015-10-09",
                "quantity": 92,
                "price": 119.27,
                "results": {"trades": 5021.72}
            }
        }
    }'''

    json_output = interface.get_trade_results(json_input)

    print(json_output)
