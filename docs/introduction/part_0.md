## Part 0: Installing trade
Trade can be installed with pip:

| pip install trade

You can also get it from the website:
http://rochars.github.io/trade/

Or from the github repository:
https://github.com/rochars/trade/

After installation, to check if everything went OK, open the Python
console and import the module:

```python
import trade
asset = trade.Asset(name='some asset')
print(asset.name)
#>> some asset
```

Now that you have trade installed, you can move on to the next part of the
