## Part 1: Creating operations
This part of the tutorial shows how to create simple purchase and
sale operations.

So now you have the trade module installed, and you can create assets:

```python
import trade
asset = trade.Asset(symbol='GOOGL')
```

Assets are the base of the trade module. Everything will revolve around them;
they represent anything that can be traded. An asset may be created with many
attributes, but for now we will only give'em a name.

Operations are the acts of purchase or sale of an asset. A purchase operation
can be created like this:

```python
import trade

# create the asset
asset = trade.Asset(symbol='GOOGL')

# create the operation
operation = trade.Operation(
                asset=asset,
                quantity=10,
                price=50.4,
                date='2015-10-01'
            )
```

Notice that the quantity is a positive value; it means that this is a purchase
operation.

A sale operation would look like this:
```python
import trade

# create the asset
asset = trade.Asset(symbol='GOOGL')

# create the operation
operation = trade.Operation(
                asset=asset,
                quantity=-10,
                price=52.39,
                date='2015-10-01'
            )
```

Notice the negative value on the quantity. Negative quantity values are used
to represent a sale operation.

Now that you can create purchase and sale operations, you can move on to
the next part of the tutorial: [Part 2: Accumulating assets](part_2).
