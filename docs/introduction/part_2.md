## Part 2: Accumulating assets
Now that we can create operations, let's create a series of operations
and let the trade module calculate the resulting position of the asset.

We will use the Portfolio class to accumulate the operations and create
our portfolio.

So now we have the trade module installed an can create purchase and
sale operations:

```python
import trade

# create the asset
asset = trade.Asset(symbol='GOOGL')

# create the purchase operation buying 10 stocks
purchase = trade.Operation(
                asset=asset,
                quantity=10,
                price=50.4,
                date='2015-10-01'
            )
# create the sale operation selling 5 stocks
sale = trade.Operation(
                asset=asset,
                quantity=-5,
                price=52.39,
                date='2015-10-02'
            )
```

It is now that the trade module really comes to work. We are going to create
a Portfolio object to hold the operations and calculate their results.

Creating a Portfolio object is very simple:

```python
import trade

portfolio = trade.Portfolio()
```

and your're done. Portfolios provide the method accumulate(), which is used
to receive an operation object and update the portfolio information regarding
thar asset. So, considering the sale and purchase operations that we created
before, we could use a Portfolio object to calculate the results of that
Operation and also the how much of the asset we still have in our Portfolio.

It would look like this:

```python
import trade

# create the asset
asset = trade.Asset(symbol='GOOGL')

# create the purchase operation buying 10 stocks
purchase = trade.Operation(
                asset=asset,
                quantity=10,
                price=50.4,
                date='2015-10-01'
            )
# create the sale operation selling 5 stocks
sale = trade.Operation(
                asset=asset,
                quantity=-5,
                price=52.39,
                date='2015-10-02'
            )

# Create the portfolio object
portfolio = trade.Portfolio()

# Accumulate the operations on the portfolio
portfolio.accumulate(sale)
portfolio.accumulate(purchase)
```

Portfolios have a attribute called assets, wich is a dictionary indexed
by Asset object references. Every operation is accumulated on this attribute,
under the key of the operation's Asset. This process uses a Accumulator
object that we will discuss later. Right now, we can check the results of our
operations by just:

```python

# We informed two operations; one buying 10 stocks of an
# asset in 2015-10-01, and a second operations selling
# 5 stocks of that same asset on 2015-10-02. Now
# we check the asset's quantity on the accumulator:
print(portfolio.assets['GOOGL'].quantity)
#> 5

# The portfolio also calcultates the average price of the
# assets it is accumulating. In this case, as we just made
# a purchase and a sale, the average price still the same
# price of the purchase.
print(portfolio.assets['GOOGL'].price)
#> 50.4

# We sold the asset for a higher price than what it was bought;
# this generated a profit. We can check the results relative
# to each asset that is being accumulated on the Portfolio:
print(portfolio.assets['GOOGL'].results)
#> {'trades': 9.949999999999989}
```

Now that you can create operations and keep your assets on a portfolio, you can
move on to the next part of the tutorial:
