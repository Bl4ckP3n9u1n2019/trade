# The Operation Container
A container for operations.

The OperationContainer was designed to execute tasks on groups of
operations. Its common uses are:

- To group all operations that happened on the same date
- To identify the daytrades among the operations
- Prorate commissions and other costs by all the operations
- Find rates for the operations, if needed
- To group all daytrades and common operations with the same asset on a single
operation, if any, and on a single daytrade, if any.

## Commissions
The container prorates fixed commissions by its operations based on their volume.

## Rates
By default all OperationContainer objects have a reference to a TaxManager
object. This default tax manager will always return an empty dictionary.
If you need to apply volume-based percentual fees to your operations, you must
