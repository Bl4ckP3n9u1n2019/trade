    A TradingFees class returns the correspondent percentual fee for
    an Operation. This base TaxManager implements a dummy interface
    that will return a empty set of fees every time it is called.

    Every OperationContainer has a reference to this class. If you
    need to implement fees in your application you must create your
    own TradingFees implementation and then replace the reference in
    the OperationContainer object by doing this:

        container.trading_fees = YourTradingFees

    Your TradingFees implementation must obey this class interface.
