class OperationContainer(object):
    """A container for operations.

    An OperationContainer is used to group operations that occurred on
    the same date and then perform tasks on them.

    The main task task of the OperationContainer is to fetch the
    resulting positions from a group of Operations.

    This is achieved by calling this method:
        fetch_positions()

    Every time fetch_positions() is called the OperationContainer
    execute this tasks behind the scenes:

    - Execute all tasks defined in self.tasks. By default, no task is
      listed. Tasks are functions like this:
            def some_task(container)
      that receive an OperationContainer object and perform some work
      on the container data.

    - Create positions in self.positions for all operations in
      the container. Positions are all the operations with the same
      asset grouped in a single operation.

    Attributes:
        date: A string 'YYYY-mm-dd' representing the date of the
            operations on the container.
        operations: A list of Operation instances.
        positions: a dict of positions with this format:
            self.positions = {
                'position type': {
                    Asset.symbol: Operation,
                    ...
                },
                ...
            }
        tasks: a list of functions. The functions will
            be called in the order they are defined in this list when
            fetch_positions() is called. Every listed function must
            receive a OperationContainer object. They are like this:
                def some_task(container):
                    #do some stuff with container...
            The functions may change the Operation objects in
            self.operations, if needed (like when you separate
            daytrades from other operations).
